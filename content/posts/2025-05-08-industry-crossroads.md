In this session, we discussed the state of our industry and the possible futures that it might have. To begin, we started with a very simple question:

## How are you feeling?

I would summarize these opinions as a mix of apprehension, frustration, and cautious optimism, largely driven by the rapid advancements in AI tools and a series of recent industry shocks including some big closures.

There's a strong sense that major changes are coming due to AI tools and integration into pipelines. There's little doubt that these tools will make things better, but getting the time to implement them properly amongst production schedules is going to be difficult. Not to mention the legal and technical challenges that we'll be faced with.

And what about the punches that keep coming? After the pandemic and more recent strikes, many are rightfully worried about the future of their studios or the stability of the industry as a whole. As we look at the changes that AI might bring, we start to ask questions like: what is the value that we bring as pipeline developers? Is it the code that we write (which an AI might learn to do)? Or do we define ourselves by something less tangible?

There were also questions about junior positions, and what an entry-level job looks like in the age of AI, where these models might be able to do a lot of what the juniors would have before. We'll have to be quite conscious of this moving forward to ensure that there's still a viable career ladder with accessible lower rungs.

## Where will pipeline development be in 5 years?

While AI and automation will continue to be more and more useful, there's a sense that folks will still need foundational software development skills in order to succeed. I suppose that this comes from the idea that we will be combining these models and other automation tools to put together pipelines, as we always have. We might become more productive or be able to do things more quickly, but there's an argument to be made that the fundamental work is the same.

That being said, we also discussed the idea that pipeline might end up moving more towards the realm of devops and RnD work. This is an extension of the ideas above, but provides the opinion that there will be much more high-level experimentation and integration work rather than actual code writing.

Similarly, we talked about the idea of throwaway code. In a world where AI can generate a whole library, plugin or website for you, do you even need to maintain it? When a change is needed could you instead just regenerate the whole thing with new requirements and throw away the old one? This is a really interesting concept, and one could argue that we are already close to that for simple scripts and one-of commands.

We generally agreed that AI also makes it much easier for you to jump into a DCC, framework or other domain that you don't know very well. Paired with good foundational skills, an AI model can help explain and translate what you know into different areas. In some way, then, we can imagine that pipeline developers could become even better polyglots and be able to support a wider set of applications more easily through the use of these tools.

## LLMs for Coding

From here, our discussion turned more towards the use of AI for development tasks. Our opinions here seem to align with the broader sentiment that LLMs are currently good at some aspects of the job, but certainly not a replacement.

Writing the foundations of new unit tests; super-powered tab completion; writing documentation; and rubber-ducking were the most common and successful uses that we were talking about in this session.

## Final Thoughts

AI has already changed the way that we work in pipeline. It also presents a lot of new opportunities for learning and applying these technologies in the pipelines that we build. As we go through this transition, it's important to remember that a lot of the worries that we have about its effect on our profession is the same worry that artists have about theirs. The mix of genuine excitement and reasonable concern seems to be in a balance that we are all working through at the moment and it will be interesting to see where things land in 6 months and 5 years down the road.
