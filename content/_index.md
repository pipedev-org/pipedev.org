## About Us

Our goal is to bring together the community of {{% tooltip VFX "Visual Effects" %}}, animation, and game pipeline developers to talk shop. We are based in North America, but our events also run online and the group's membership is completely open. We encourage anyone who is interested to come by, or log on, and <a class="button" href="javascript:signup();">join the discussion</a>!

## The Forum

Once every few months, we gather to discuss a handful of topics related to our craft. It's an opportunity to reflect on the past, talk about the present, and dream into the future. With a little organization and note-taking, we try to capture the current thoughts and opinions of the community as a record for the future to look back on, and for those who are not able to be with us in person.
