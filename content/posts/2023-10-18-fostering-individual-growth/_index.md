This discussion topic comes as a continuation of one of the group discussions from the “Global CG Pipelines” Birds of a Feather session at this year’s Siggraph.

We held this session online for a shorter time and during the work day (for those in Pacific time, anyway) which turned out to be much better attended than I could have hoped for — please reach out to me with any feedback on this, but I’d say expect to see more like this in the future given the numbers that we had.

## Fostering Individual Growth

We started this forum by looking at career ladders in the pipeline space. I am removing specific studio names from this section, as always, but it’s still a valuable comparison.

One studio noted a current pipeline TD ladder as being: Associate, Level I, Level II, and then Senior. Another, less structured, mentioned render wranglers and sys ops roles mainly moving into pipeline as in either a support or dev role and then often moving up to an FX TD that might then eventually become a CG Supervisor or similar role.

It seemed like these two examples were fairly indicative of what the rest of the industry was doing, either structured into similar levels or less organized and largely flat in the pipeline space itself. We did start to consider that there are really two avenues of growth in pipeline: either as an individual contributor or as a leader/manager.

These two paths are typical in other technology and software spaces, but may not always considered so directly in the pipeline space. Most companies imagine that senior TDs will become leads, but there is also an important track to something like a staff or principal TD that doesn’t involve taking a managerial position.

To complicate the discussion, many studios consider the TD role as strictly a support role, whereas others expect pipeline TDs to be responsible for building and maintaining all pipeline code and tools. There are even more studios that define the role somewhere in between or as a combination of both. This disparity can make the career progression a little hard to define and standardize across companies and even within a studio as individuals might wear different hats on different productions or even day-to-day.

Sometimes this fluidity keeps the job interesting, and can be one of the things that makes pipeline work so fun — but on the other hand, a more defined role can help to create clearer measures of success, a more appropriate progression ladder, and even more equitable processes. There is a potentially dangerous inclination here to “officialize” the role as a development role, but finding people who are passionate about filling the support need is often crucial to meeting the actual needs of the position.

These measures of success are one of the hardest for pipeline roles and don’t just include technical skills. We must also consider leadership, ownership of issues, stakeholder management, autonomy, and scope of responsibilities to name a few other aspects of the role. In many ways, the TD role can be seen as needing to have and develop the same skills as any software role but then applying the skills in a different way.

This problem gets even harder at smaller studios where the pipeline TD often presides over an ever larger domain of responsibilities including R&D, render management, core pipeline development, infrastructure, and support. Why do smaller studios do this? It seems that there’s an economy of scale problem with the TD and other pipeline roles.

Because smaller productions still need pipeline support, but don’t have the budget for a full-time TD, studios end up needing to pool resources across many productions to run the pipeline (just like any overhead role). The shape of the studio and nature of the work, then, ultimately determine how many pipeline roles can be hired and thus how broad of a domain each one needs to be responsible for.

Understanding this reality can help to inform strategies for mitigating some of the issues that we talked about earlier. For example, facilitating good collaboration between pipeline and artists or department leads can be a really great way, to reduce the specific domain knowledge that the pipeline team needs to know — instead, being able to ask and leverage another resource that does.

## Cross-Pollination

So what are the best methods for spreading skills within the pipeline department and fostering growth in a variety of disciplines?

Given the project nature of our industry, we tend to see a decent amount of turnover in between studios as folks who are crewed to specific shows move from studio to studio. This is a natural cross-pollination, but not something that I think we really want to encourage from the perspective of any individual studio that’s looking to foster growth in their existing team.

Internally, there are a few things that we can reach for. Firstly, most “modern” development practices have similar goals and are easy ways to encourage knowledge sharing within teams. Think code reviews, pair programming, post-mortems, unit testing, etc.

Secondly, (and I am going to steal this phrase from our meeting) is the concept of fostering an “inner source” culture. Playing on the idea of open-source software, inner-source aims to create a similar culture of openness inside the company for all proprietary code. Ultimately, this means encouraging a world where any developer feels confident in discovering and reading other source code, submitting issues, and developing new features or fixing bugs as needed. In other words, we detach the code projects from the organization’s structure and encourage shared development and maintenance. Relying on the safety of best practices and common workflows is key here.

Taking vacations is also a great tool, surprisingly. These don’t even have to be real vacations, but making the “usual” support person unavailable for some amount of time forces other folks on the team to pick up issues and work through them — learning the system as they go. Although having someone to support this process can make the whole thing smoother, sometimes access to an expert allows everyone to fall back onto the easiest path of letting them handle it (to the detriment of the cross-pollination effort).

Creating time and space for people to explore and work on something new is another tool for this job. Whether it’s a few scheduled hours per week, extended sabbaticals, regular cooldowns between development cycles or one-off investigation efforts, this time can be really effective at opening minds to new tools, skills, and ways of thinking.

Previously, we also discussed the idea of having pipeline folks work with artists in order to reduce their need to know specific disciplines. They will undoubtedly be exposed to new workflows and ideas in that process as well. Similarly, having someone from the pipeline side contribute to shot work can be equally fruitful — though this work is not for everyone, and some may simply come away resentful if it’s not their cup of tea.

This brings us to a larger theme of the discussion here, which is that every person and every studio will be more responsive and able to approach certain of these scenarios and ideas.

### Poll Results

These polls were taken during the discussion. Keep in mind that not everyone answers and the sample size is small to begin with. They can be interesting to see but are not representative of any particular company or even the industry as a whole.
